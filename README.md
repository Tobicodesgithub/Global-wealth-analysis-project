# Global-wealth-analysis-project
This project breakdown global wealth distribution using Microsoft Excel

## 1. Introduction

This project explores a dataset of global billionaires, focusing on analyzing their demographic,
economic, and business-related characteristics. The aim is to uncover trends across regions,
industries, and individual profiles using Excel.

## 2. Problem Statement
We seek to answer key questions such as: - Which countries and industries produce the most
billionaires? - What is the age distribution among billionaires? - Is there a correlation between
national economic indicators (GDP, CPI, etc.) and billionaire presence? - How do self-made
billionaires compare to inherited wealth individuals?

## 3. Skills Demonstrated
- Excel Data Cleaning
- Pivot Table Analysis
- Data Transformation (Column renaming, type conversions)
- Data Visualization (Charts, Dashboards).

## 4. Data Sourcing
The dataset originates from a curated list of global billionaires. It includes personal and financial
information such as: - Name, Age, Country, and Industry - Source of Wealth - Economic indicators:
GDP, CPI, Life Expectancy, Tax Rate, etc. The primary data is located on the "Data" sheet, which
contains over 20 columns of structured information.

## 5. Analysis & Visualization
Key insights: - United States has the most billionaires. - Technology and Finance are top industries.
- Many billionaires are self-made. - Age trends show most are in their 50s or 60s. - Economic
prosperity indicators (GDP, CPI) align with billionaire density. Visuals include bar charts, pie charts,
and heatmaps (designed in Excel). The dashboard sheet can be further developed for reporting

## 6. Conclusion and Recommendation
The data indicates a strong link between national economic strength and billionaire presence,
though personal innovation plays a major role. For deeper insights, future work should include
time-series data and more variables like education and business history. Enhancing the dashboard
would improve presentation readiness.
